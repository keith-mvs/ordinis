# Fibonacci ADX Strategy — Implementation Analysis

**Date:** 2025-12-23
**Author:** Ordinis Code Audit

---

## Summary ✅

I reviewed the strategy specification (`docs/strategies/FIBONACCI_ADX.md`) and the implementation (`src/ordinis/application/strategies/fibonacci_adx.py` + underlying models) and produced a concise implementation analysis with findings, risks, and a prioritized remediation plan.

Next step: implement prioritized fixes (tiered stop-losses, extension targets, trailing exit, tests) — tell me if you want me to proceed with the code changes and which items to prioritize first.

## Files inspected 🔎

- docs/strategies/FIBONACCI_ADX.md  (strategy spec & roadmap)
- src/ordinis/application/strategies/fibonacci_adx.py (strategy wrapper)
- src/ordinis/engines/signalcore/models/fibonacci_retracement.py (model)
- src/ordinis/engines/signalcore/models/adx_trend.py (model)

No unit tests were found specifically targeting `FibonacciADXStrategy`.

## Key Findings (Behavioral Parity & Gaps) ⚠️

1. **Correct Pairing of Indicators** ✅
   - The strategy properly composes `ADXTrendModel` and `FibonacciRetracementModel` and only produces a combined `ENTRY` when ADX indicates a strong trend and the Fibonacci model finds a key level.

2. **Stop/Target logic mismatch vs. spec** ❌
   - Spec (docs): tiered stop-losses based on entry level (e.g., entry at 38.2% → stop just below 50% level; entry at 61.8% → stop below swing low).
   - Code: single rule used for longs: `stop_loss = swing_low * 0.98` and `take_profit = swing_high`. This does not implement tiered stops and can produce inappropriate stops (too wide or too tight) depending on entry level.

3. **Fibonacci extensions and partial take-profits missing** ❌
   - Spec recommends extension targets (1.272, 1.618) and partial exits (take_profit_2/3). Implementation only sets `take_profit = swing_high`.

4. **Chandelier trailing / post-breakout behavior missing** ❌
   - Doc roadmap suggests switching to a Chandelier exit after the swing high is breached; not implemented.

5. **ADX slope (trend acceleration) not used** ❌
   - Spec's ADX Slope enhancement is not used in `FibonacciADXStrategy`. `ADXTrendModel` computes ADX and regime but does not expose an explicit `trend_accelerating` boolean; strategy does not use ADX slope to gate or size entries.

6. **Volume profile confirmation / VSA absent** ❌
   - Roadmap includes requiring declining volume on the pullback and increasing volume on the bounce; neither the strategy nor models evaluate volume conditions.

7. **Swing detection fragility noted** ⚠️
   - `FibonacciRetracementModel` uses `rolling` min/max over `swing_lookback`. This matches the spec's baseline but is susceptible to outlier bars; specification suggests fractal-based swing detection for robustness (not implemented).

8. **Risk sizing enforcement missing** ⚠️
   - The doc mentions a 3% max position size; the strategy returns the `Signal` with stop and TP metadata but does not enforce position sizing—this is expected to be handled downstream (Portfolio/Execution). There is no explicit metadata `max_position_size` or `risk_fraction` added by the strategy.

9. **Tests are missing** ⚠️
   - No unit tests were found that validate the tiered stop rules, ADX gating, or expected signal metadata for the high-profit enhancements.

## Concrete Recommendations (Prioritized) 🔧

1. **Implement Tiered Stop-Loss Logic (High priority)** ✅
   - Replace the `stop_loss = swing_low * 0.98` logic with level-aware stop rules:
     - Entry @ 38.2% → stop just below 50.0% level
     - Entry @ 50.0% → stop just below 61.8% level
     - Entry @ 61.8% → stop below swing low
   - Add unit tests verifying stop placement for each entry level.

2. **Add Fibonacci Extension Targets & Multi-TP Metadata (High priority)** ✅
   - Add 1.272 and 1.618 extension computations and attach `take_profit_2` and `take_profit_3` into the signal `metadata`.
   - Add tests verifying these targets are properly computed and included in `Signal.metadata`.

3. **Chandelier Exit / Trailing Stop Support (Medium priority)**
   - Implement `ChandelierExit` (or `ChandelierExitModel`) in `SignalCore` and add metadata to allow `PortfolioEngine` to switch to trailing mode after `take_profit_1` is breached.

4. **ADX Slope Gate & Sizing (Medium priority)**
   - Extend `ADXTrendModel` to compute `adx_slope` (e.g., ADX_t - ADX_{t-n}) and expose `trend_accelerating` in metadata.
   - Use this in strategy to tighten sizing or make entry conditional.

5. **Volume Confirmation (Medium priority)**
   - Add optional volume checks in `FibonacciRetracementModel`/strategy: require pullback on declining volume and bounce on rising volume.

6. **Fractal-Based Swing Detection (Low → Medium priority)**
   - Replace simple rolling min/max with fractal or peak/trough detection to produce more stable swing pivots. Add unit tests that simulate false-positive swings.

7. **Add Position Sizing Metadata (Low priority)**
   - Populate `Signal.metadata` with `max_position_size` or `risk_fraction` computed from stop distance and a desired risk budget (e.g., 1–3% of equity).

8. **Add Tests & CI Checks (High priority)**
   - Add tests under `tests/test_engines/test_signalcore/test_models/` (or `tests/test_application/test_fibonacci_adx.py`) that:
     - Assert ENTRY only when ADX >= threshold and DI difference >= di_threshold
     - Validate tiered stop placement per level
     - Validate extension target calculation
     - Validate ADX slope gating when enabled
     - Validate volume confirmation when enabled

9. **Docs & Example Backtest (Medium priority)**
   - Update `docs/strategies/FIBONACCI_ADX.md` to document exact stop-tier rules, extension targets, and the config flags for enabling enhancements.
   - Add a small demo backtest script showing a pyramiding + extension capture example and add sample outputs to `artifacts/`.

## Proposed Implementation Tasks (Actionable TODOs) 📋

- [ ] Task A: **Tiered stops** — modify `src/ordinis/application/strategies/fibonacci_adx.py` and `fibonacci_retracement.py` to compute and include next-level stops; add tests.
- [ ] Task B: **Extensions** — add extension computations (1.272, 1.618) and return `take_profit_2/3` in signal metadata; add tests.
- [ ] Task C: **Chandelier Exit** — implement a `ChandelierExitModel` in `src/ordinis/engines/signalcore/models/chandelier_exit.py` and support switching exit type in `PortfolioEngine`/position manager.
- [ ] Task D: **ADX slope** — extend `ADXTrendModel` to provide `adx_slope` and `trend_accelerating` metadata; optionally expose as strategy gating parameter.
- [ ] Task E: **Volume confirmation** — add optional checks (config-driven) to require declining volume on pullback and increasing volume on bounce.
- [ ] Task F: **Fractal swing detection** — investigate and implement more robust swing detection methods (fractal or local extrema) and add tests.
- [ ] Task G: **Testing** — add unit and integration tests validating all behaviors above.
- [ ] Task H: **Documentation** — update `FIBONACCI_ADX.md` with precise algorithmic rules and an examples section showing how to enable the enhancements.

## Quick Example: Tiered Stop Implementation (pseudo)

```python
# inside generate_signal when determining stop based on nearest_level
level = metadata['nearest_level']  # e.g. '38.2%'
if level == '38.2%':
    stop_loss = all_levels['50.0%'] * 0.995
elif level == '50.0%':
    stop_loss = all_levels['61.8%'] * 0.995
elif level == '61.8%':
    stop_loss = swing_low * 0.98
```

## Next Steps (I can implement these) ▶️

- Option A (small, high‑impact): I implement **Tiered stops**, add `take_profit_2/3`, and add unit tests and docs (small PR).
- Option B (bigger): Implement Chandelier Exit, ADX slope gating, volume confirmation, pyramiding, fractal swing detection, and integration tests.

Tell me which option you want me to start with (A or B) or supply another priority order; I’ll open a PR and include tests and docs accordingly.
