# Network Risk Parity and Network-Based Portfolio Strategies: A Comprehensive Overview

## Overview of Network-Based Portfolio Construction 
Traditional portfolio theory (Markowitz 1952) has faced critiques for producing concentrated and unstable portfolios【1†L71-L78】【1†L73-L81】. In response, recent research has explored **network-based portfolio construction**, leveraging graph theory to model relationships between assets and enhance diversification. In a financial network, assets are nodes and edges reflect correlations or other similarity measures between asset returns【25†L40-L48】. Early work by Peralta and Zareei (2016) established a bridge between Markowitz’s framework and network theory, demonstrating a **negative relationship between an asset’s centrality and its optimal portfolio weight**【25†L40-L48】. In other words, *highly central assets (deeply connected in the correlation network) should receive lower weights*, while more peripheral (low-centrality) assets are overweighted to avoid concentrating on hubs that amplify risk【25†L40-L48】. This insight introduced the idea of weighting assets *inversely to their network importance*, laying the foundation for network-based allocation strategies.

Researchers have since proposed various methods to build portfolios from correlation networks. Techniques include constructing **minimum spanning tree (MST)** or other filtered networks from asset correlations (as pioneered by Mantegna 1999; Onnela 2003) to identify clusters of similar assets【21†L88-L96】【21†L90-L98】. By capturing the market’s intrinsic community structure, these network methods help *spread investments across hidden clusters beyond standard sector classifications*, thereby achieving truer diversification【38†L52-L60】【38†L54-L62】. For example, applying clustering algorithms or MSTs to a stock universe can reveal groups of assets that behave as a unit (e.g. travel, energy, and hospitality stocks acting as one cluster during COVID-19) – information that can be used to diversify across those community clusters【38†L52-L60】【38†L62-L70】. Beyond visualization, **centrality measures** from graph theory are directly used for portfolio design: assets’ degrees, eigenvector centralities, betweenness, etc., quantify each asset’s influence in the network. These metrics have been linked to both diversification benefits and systemic risk, as nodes that are hubs or bridges can amplify shocks in crises【38†L102-L110】【38†L104-L113】. Thus, network science provides tools (clustering, centrality, network filtering) to construct portfolios that explicitly account for the web of correlations among assets.

## The Network Risk Parity Approach 
One notable innovation in this area is **Network Risk Parity (NRP)** – a graph-theory-based allocation methodology introduced by Ciciretti and Pallotta (2024)【1†L46-L54】. Network Risk Parity was conceived as a counterpart to Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP) (Lopez de Prado, 2016), replacing HRP’s tree clustering with a full network approach【1†L79-L87】【1†L100-L107】. Both HRP and NRP ultimately aim to allocate risk evenly without solving the unstable quadratic optimization of Markowitz. However, HRP relies on clustering assets into a dendrogram (using a chosen distance metric and linkage) then applying inverse-variance weighting within that hierarchy【1†L79-L87】【1†L82-L89】. By contrast, **Network Risk Parity builds portfolios using graph theory**, capturing the *many-to-many* relationships between securities that hierarchical clustering may overlook【1†L52-L60】【1†L55-L63】. 

The mathematical connection point is that HRP and NRP both derive weights proportional to the inverse of certain eigenvalues of a modified covariance matrix【1†L100-L108】【1†L107-L114】. In HRP, this arises indirectly from the recursive bisection of the covariance into clusters. In NRP, the approach is more direct: one constructs an **adjacency matrix** based on asset covariances or correlations, then uses graph centrality (notably eigenvector centrality) to determine the influence of each node in the network【1†L107-L114】. The **optimal weights in NRP are set inversely to each asset’s eigen-centrality**, ensuring a fully invested, long-only portfolio that *underweights the most network-central securities*【1†L100-L108】【1†L107-L114】. Intuitively, an asset heavily connected to others (high eigenvector centrality) carries risk that is already reflected via its neighbors, so giving it a smaller weight avoids redundancy. Conversely, assets that are more independent (low centrality) receive larger weights, increasing diversification【25†L40-L48】. A softmax normalization is applied to these inverse-centrality weights to ensure positivity and sum-to-one allocation【1†L99-L107】【1†L100-L108】. 

Empirical results for Network Risk Parity have been promising. By better accounting for the market’s network structure, NRP portfolios tend to be *less concentrated than mean–variance portfolios* and often outperform competing methods like HRP, especially as the number of assets grows【1†L61-L65】【1†L62-L65】. Ciciretti and Pallotta report that NRP, leveraging the **minimum spanning tree (MST)** of the correlation network to represent systematic risk, achieved higher risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratios) than HRP in simulations【1†L61-L65】【1†L62-L65】. The MST efficiently captures the primary connections in the market, and weighting inversely to centrality within the MST yields more balanced risk contributions across assets. Notably, **NRP eliminates the need to arbitrarily choose a distance metric or linkage criterion** (a sensitivity in HRP), since the network weighting emerges from graph properties rather than exogenous clustering parameters【1†L52-L60】【1†L55-L63】. In summary, Network Risk Parity extends the risk-parity philosophy (equalizing risk) into the realm of network science, using eigenvalues and centrality to create diversified portfolios that reflect the complex web of correlations.

## Centrality-Based Weighting and Portfolio Performance 
A cornerstone of network-based allocation is the use of **centrality measures** (e.g. degree, eigenvector, betweenness) to inform asset weights. Peralta and Zareei (2016) showed theoretically that in the Markowitz mean-variance framework, *optimal weights are inversely related to assets’ centralities in the correlation network*【25†L40-L48】. This means an asset strongly connected to others (high centrality) contributes relatively more variance to any portfolio and thus should be held in smaller proportion for an efficient risk/return trade-off. Their empirical tests confirmed that **portfolios tilting towards low-centrality stocks outperform** naive benchmarks, even yielding significant Carhart alpha【25†L42-L51】【25†L52-L56】. The intuition is that low-centrality assets provide more idiosyncratic (diversifying) risk, whereas high-centrality assets embed common risk that is not rewarded extra in returns.

Subsequent studies have explored *which centrality metrics best enhance diversification*. **Eigenvector centrality** (which accounts for both the quantity and quality of connections) has been a popular choice, as it encapsulates a node’s influence in the entire network. For instance, Výrost et al. (2019) constructed portfolios using three different centrality measures – eigenvector, betweenness, and a measure called “expected force” – across several network representations (complete graph, MST, planar filtered graph, etc.)【9†L39-L47】【9†L43-L51】. They found that **incorporating centrality-based adjustments improved key risk-return characteristics** out-of-sample for a broad multi-asset portfolio【9†L47-L55】【9†L53-L60】. In particular, strategies that penalized assets with high centrality tended to have *lower tail risk and volatility*, indicating more robust diversification【9†L47-L56】【9†L53-L60】. These results echo the notion that central nodes concentrate systematic risk, so down-weighting them yields more balanced portfolios.

**Degree centrality** (the number of connections an asset has above a certain correlation threshold) is a simpler metric that also has intuitive appeal: a stock connected to many others may be reflecting broad market factors, whereas a stock with few connections might offer niche exposure. Some approaches use degree or related measures to create “diversification scores” for assets. For example, a recent study by Jaeger and Marinelli (2022) proposed *equal-volatility allocation combined with network centrality ranking*【28†L47-L55】. In their **Network Diversification** strategy, each asset is first scaled to have equal volatility (a risk parity idea), then weighted inversely to a centrality measure (such as degree or eigenvector)【28†L47-L55】【28†L49-L57】. This ensures that no asset dominates the risk (volatility equalization) and that centrally connected assets do not dominate the portfolio (centrality-based weighting). The authors show that such centrality-weighted risk parity portfolios can outperform traditional risk parity and minimum-variance portfolios, *delivering more stable performance even when short positions are allowed*【28†L39-L47】【28†L47-L55】. This highlights that centrality-informed weighting is effective not only in long-only contexts but also in long-short portfolios where controlling extreme leverage on highly correlated assets is crucial【28†L39-L47】【28†L43-L50】.

Importantly, centrality metrics can be **time-varying**, so network-based strategies often adapt over time. Gregnanin *et al.* (2024) provide a recent example by introducing a *signature-based similarity network* for stocks and then examining centrality vs. volatility relationships【16†L985-L994】【16†L995-L1003】. They find an inverse relationship between assets’ network centrality and their return volatility in normal conditions – low-volatility stocks tend to occupy more central positions in the similarity network – which flips for extremely high centrality values【16†L985-L994】【16†L997-L1003】. This nuanced finding suggests that centrality-weighting might reduce risk up to a point, but extremely central assets could be safe havens until they become too dominant. Overall, the use of eigenvector and degree centrality in portfolio construction is well-supported: it **penalizes highly interconnected assets** and tilts towards those providing independent risk, thereby enhancing diversification and often improving risk-adjusted returns【25†L40-L48】【9†L47-L55】.

## Correlation Networks for Diversification and Systemic Risk 
Correlation networks not only aid in portfolio construction but also serve as a tool for analyzing **systemic risk and market stability**. By mapping the financial system as a network, one can identify critical nodes whose failure could have outsized impacts. For instance, centrality measures like betweenness (measuring nodes that lie on many shortest paths between others) can reveal financial instruments or institutions that act as key conduits for risk propagation【38†L102-L110】【38†L104-L113】. In an investment portfolio context, this translates to recognizing assets or sectors that could trigger chain reactions. *Highly central or “hub” assets can amplify shocks*, so portfolios heavily exposed to them may not be as resilient in crises【38†L102-L110】【38†L103-L111】. Conversely, holding more peripheral assets (from a network perspective) can reduce the likelihood of simultaneous crashes, as they are less entwined in the main web of market contagion.

Researchers have used network models to quantify such **contagion pathways** and improve portfolio robustness. Clemente *et al.* (2022) introduced a method to measure how “embedded” each asset is in the correlation network by adapting the clustering coefficient metric【21†L103-L111】. The clustering coefficient reflects how interconnected an asset’s neighbors are – effectively capturing local redundancy. Clemente and colleagues argue that an asset with a high clustering coefficient is deeply embedded in a network clique (group of tightly connected assets) and thus offers less diversification benefit【21†L103-L111】【21†L105-L113】. Their network-based optimization incorporates this idea by favoring assets that contribute unique connections (lower local clustering), leading to portfolios that maintain performance even when common risk factors surge【21†L103-L111】【21†L107-L114】. Such approaches explicitly account for *system-wide interconnectedness* in the objective function, unlike classic minimum-variance which only considers pairwise correlations【21†L109-L115】【21†L111-L114】.

Beyond academic studies, financial authorities and institutions have embraced network analysis for risk management. The CFA Institute highlights network theory as a practical tool for **smarter diversification and early warning of stress**. In a 2025 practitioner brief, Konstantinov and Sadeghi underscore that hidden connectivity patterns can signal regime shifts or instability before they manifest in prices【38†L116-L124】【38†L117-L125】. For example, monitoring the **evolution of correlation network structure** in real time – changes in network density or the emergence of a tightly connected cluster – can alert traders to breakdowns in diversification or looming volatility spikes【38†L116-L124】【38†L119-L127】. This underscores that correlation networks are not static: during a systemic crisis, correlations tend to spike and the network may “condense” into one giant cluster, erasing diversification. Network-based indicators (like network density, modularity, or centrality shifts) therefore serve as quantitative measures of systemic risk buildup. By incorporating such metrics, **portfolio managers can adjust exposures proactively** – for instance, trimming positions in assets that suddenly become central in the network (indicating they are co-moving with many others) and adding to more isolated positions. In summary, correlation networks provide a rich framework for understanding diversification in normal times and contagion in stressed times, enabling more robust portfolio allocation and risk surveillance【38†L52-L60】【38†L102-L110】.

## Extensions: Short-Selling and Regime-Switching Strategies 
Researchers have also explored extensions of network-based strategies, including allowing **short-selling (long–short portfolios)** and **regime-switching approaches** that adjust allocations based on market conditions. The integration of short positions is particularly relevant for hedge funds or tactical strategies that aim to be market-neutral. A challenge in long–short portfolio design is that unconstrained optimization can lead to extreme levered bets on assets that appear uncorrelated. Network-based methods help mitigate this by identifying when assets are effectively redundant. Jaeger and Marinelli (2022) explicitly note that traditional correlation-based methods can yield “extreme allocations in long-short portfolio strategies,” and they address this by combining network centrality with equal-risk positioning【28†L39-L47】【28†L43-L50】. Their **network diversification strategy** is built to be *suitable for long-short investments*, meaning it remains stable even when short positions are included【28†L47-L55】【28†L49-L57】. By capping exposure to highly central assets (which would otherwise dominate a levered portfolio), the approach avoids concentrated short bets that could backfire. Empirical tests showed these centrality-informed long–short portfolios maintained favorable risk characteristics and outperformed several benchmarks on a risk-adjusted basis【28†L47-L55】【28†L53-L58】.

Another recent advancement by Gregnanin *et al.* (2024) examined their network-based allocation under both **long-only and short-allowed scenarios**. They report that using a **signature-based similarity network** (which captures non-linear time series patterns) improved portfolio performance relative to a standard correlation-network approach *in both cases, with and without short selling*【35†L7-L15】【35†L37-L45】. When shorting was permitted, the signature-based network portfolio consistently achieved higher cumulative returns and Sharpe ratios than a baseline network strategy that used the Pearson correlation matrix【35†L37-L45】【35†L43-L51】. Interestingly, the authors found the baseline network strategies yielded negative performance when leverage was allowed, whereas the more robust signature-based approach still produced positive outcomes【35†L37-L45】【35†L43-L51】. This suggests that **network strategies can be extended to market-neutral portfolios**, but careful construction (e.g. using improved similarity measures or constraints) is needed to harness the benefits of short selling without amplifying risk.

Network-based allocation methods have also been tailored to different **market regimes or volatility environments**. Peralta and Zareei (2016) proposed a simple yet effective regime-switching rule tied to market volatility【1†L91-L99】. In their strategy, the portfolio *tilts toward the most central stocks during low-volatility periods*, on the rationale that when markets are calm, the well-connected “blue chip” stocks can be safely held (they provide stable exposure)【1†L91-L99】【1†L93-L95】. However, during high-volatility periods (turbulent markets), the strategy *rotates into the least central (most peripheral) stocks*, aiming to avoid the highly interconnected assets that are likely to transmit shocks widely【1†L91-L99】【1†L93-L99】. This dynamic rebalancing between central and peripheral assets depending on the regime showed improved resilience and performance across market cycles. Essentially, it behaves offensively in calm regimes (holding the market leaders) and defensively in crisis regimes (seeking isolated havens), exploiting the network structure adaptively. The efficacy of such a regime-switching approach underscores that the **optimal network posture may change with market conditions** – networks themselves can reconfigure in crises, so a static centrality-based weighting might not always be optimal. By switching the focus to low-centrality assets in stressed times, the portfolio reduces exposure to systemic nodes at the moment when contagion risk is highest【1†L91-L99】.

In summary, the research landscape on Network Risk Parity and related network-based strategies is rich and rapidly evolving. **Academic journal articles** like those by Peralta & Zareei (2016), Výrost *et al.* (2019), and Ciciretti & Pallotta (2024) lay the theoretical and empirical groundwork for using graph centrality and networks in portfolio optimization【25†L40-L48】【9†L43-L51】【1†L52-L60】. **Textbook and institutional publications** are also acknowledging these techniques – for example, a CFA Institute brief (Konstantinov & Sadeghi 2025) explicitly lists *centrality-based weighting and network risk parity* among modern diversification methods【38†L52-L60】. Meanwhile, **whitepapers and preprints** (e.g., on SSRN and arXiv) are pushing the envelope with practical implementations: Clemente *et al.* (2022) demonstrate a centrality-enhanced risk model in a high-dimensional setting【20†L50-L58】【20†L59-L62】, and Jaeger & Marinelli (2022) introduce multiplex networks to encode multiple layers of asset relationships for more robust allocation【28†L47-L55】【28†L49-L57】. These sources collectively show that incorporating network theory – whether through eigenvector centrality weighting, community detection, or network filters – can lead to improved diversification, **equalized risk contributions (risk parity) in a network sense**, and better management of systemic risk. The availability of many references in **PDF** form (see links below) ensures that interested practitioners and researchers can delve into the details of these approaches, replicate studies, and further innovate on the promising fusion of network science and portfolio management.
