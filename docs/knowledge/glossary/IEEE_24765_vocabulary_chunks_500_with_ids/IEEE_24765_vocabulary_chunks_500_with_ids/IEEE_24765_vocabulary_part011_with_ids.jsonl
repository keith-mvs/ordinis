Realization of value normally involves a balancing of costs, risks, opportunities, and performance benefits. A value can be positive or negative. A positive value is intuitively recognized because of its relatively high desirability. A negative value is marked by its undesirability. These words have similar but not identical meaning. Worth is usually what one is willing to pay for something. Significance is about being worthy of attention. Importance is about the state or fact of being of great significance or value.
