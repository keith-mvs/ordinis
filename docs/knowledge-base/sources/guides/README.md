Okay, let's tackle this README.md for the 'guides' folder. The user wants a comprehensive overview, descriptions of each file, and a structure to help developers navigate.

First, the overview. The folder is in the knowledge base for a quantitative trading system. The guides here are probably related to structured learning paths, maybe certifications like CFA or CIPM. The files have names like 2026-l1-topics, which suggests different levels (L1, L2, Level III) and topics. So the overview should mention that these guides are for professional development in quantitative finance, covering various levels and topics.

Next, each file description. Let's look at the names:

- 2026-l1-topics-combined.pdf: Likely Level 1 topics, combined into one document. Maybe an overview of foundational concepts.
- 2026-l2-topics-combined.pdf: Same as L1 but Level 2, more advanced topics.
- 2026leveliii-portfolio-management-pathwaytopicoutline_online.pdf: Level III, portfolio management pathway. Probably focuses on advanced portfolio strategies and management techniques.
- 2026_cipm_l1_topicoutline_online.pdf: CIPM Level 1, so maybe the Certificate in Investment Performance Measurement, covering basics of performance evaluation.
- 2026_cipm_l2_topicoutline_online.pdf: CIPM Level 2, more advanced topics in performance measurement and attribution.

I need to describe each briefly, inferring from the names. Make sure to note that these are outlines or combined topics, possibly from official sources like CFA Institute or similar.

Structure section: The user wants a way to navigate. Maybe categorize by certification (like CFA vs CIPM) and by level. Also, mention that the guides are organized by year (2026) and type (topic outlines, combined guides). Suggest starting with the appropriate level based on experience, and cross-referencing with other documentation if needed.

Check if all points are covered. Overview, file descriptions, structure. Avoid markdown fences. Use headers, bullet points, etc., but without the ```markdown. Make sure it's clear and helpful for a developer to find what they need.
