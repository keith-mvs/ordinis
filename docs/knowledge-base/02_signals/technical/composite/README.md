# Composite Indicators

## Overview

Composite indicators combine multiple calculations or indicator types into a single signal generator. They typically provide more robust signals by filtering noise through multiple layers of smoothing or confirmation.

## Indicators in This Category

| File | Indicator | Components | Use Case |
|------|-----------|------------|----------|
| [macd.md](macd.md) | MACD | 2 EMAs + Signal line | Trend + momentum |
| [momentum.md](momentum.md) | ROC, Momentum, PPO | Price change calculations | Pure momentum |

## Why Composite Indicators?

1. **Noise Reduction**: Multiple smoothing layers filter out false signals
2. **Multi-Dimensional**: Capture both trend and momentum
3. **Signal Clarity**: Clear crossover or divergence signals
4. **Versatility**: Work across multiple market conditions

## Common Composite Indicator Types

### Moving Average Based
- MACD (EMA difference)
- PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator)
- TRIX (Triple smoothed EMA)

### Momentum Based
- ROC (Rate of Change)
- Momentum (Price difference)
- RSI variants (Stoch RSI, Connors RSI)

### Hybrid
- KST (Know Sure Thing - weighted ROC)
- Ultimate Oscillator (weighted timeframes)

## Best Practices

1. **Understand components**: Know what each piece measures
2. **Use for confirmation**: Not primary entry signals
3. **Watch for divergence**: Often most reliable signal
4. **Respect the lag**: Composite indicators are slower
