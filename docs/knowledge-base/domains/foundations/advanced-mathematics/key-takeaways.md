## Key Takeaways

1. **Probability foundation**: Understand distributions, moments, and tail risk
2. **Stochastic processes**: GBM is a starting point, not reality
3. **Time series**: Test for stationarity before modeling
4. **Optimization**: Consider estimation error and transaction costs
5. **ML with caution**: Beware of overfitting and non-stationarity
6. **Simulation validation**: Always validate numerical methods
7. **Fat tails matter**: Normal distribution underestimates extreme events
