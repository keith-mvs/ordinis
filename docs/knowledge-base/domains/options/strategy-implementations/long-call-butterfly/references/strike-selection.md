## Strike Selection Framework

Effective strike selection is critical for long call butterfly success. This guide covers systematic approaches to choosing optimal strikes.

---

## Key Considerations

When selecting strikes, evaluate:
1. **Price Target**: Where do you expect the underlying to move?
2. **Probability**: What's the likelihood of reaching your target?
3. **Risk/Reward**: Does the potential profit justify the risk?
4. **Liquidity**: Are the options liquid enough for good fills?
5. **Technical Levels**: Where are support/resistance zones?

## Delta-Based Selection

### Using Delta as a Guide

**Delta ranges** provide a systematic framework:

## Price Target Method

### Systematic Approach

**Step 1**: Identify price target using technical analysis

**Step 2**: Select strikes relative to target

**Step 3**: Validate risk/reward ratio

**Step 4**: Check liquidity and bid-ask spreads

## Spread Width Optimization

### Risk/Reward Tradeoffs

**Narrow Spreads**:
- Lower capital requirement
- Tighter profit zone
- More precision needed

**Wide Spreads**:
- Higher capital requirement
- Wider profit zone
- More room for error

**Optimal Width**: [Strategy-specific recommendation]

## Common Mistakes

1. **Ignoring liquidity** - Trading illiquid strikes
2. **Poor width selection** - Too wide or too narrow
3. **No technical validation** - Ignoring support/resistance
4. **Overcomplicating** - Analysis paralysis

- [ ] Price target identified
- [ ] Technical levels mapped
- [ ] Delta ranges evaluated
- [ ] Risk/reward calculated (≥1:1)
