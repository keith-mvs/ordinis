Okay, let's tackle this README.md for the 'sector' domain in the fundamental signals part of the quantitative trading system. The user wants a comprehensive overview, descriptions of each file, and a structure to help developers navigate.

First, the overview. The 'sector' domain probably relates to how different economic sectors (like technology, healthcare, etc.) are analyzed for trading signals. Since it's under fundamental signals, maybe it's about using sector-specific data to generate investment strategies. I should mention sector rotation, which is a strategy where investors move money between sectors based on market conditions. That makes sense given the file name 'sector-rotation.md'.

Next, the files. There's only one file listed: sector-rotation.md. The name suggests it's about sector rotation strategies. So I need to describe that this file likely contains explanations of sector rotation theories, methodologies, and maybe implementation details in the trading system. Since there are no other files or directories, maybe mention that this is the primary document and perhaps suggest that additional files could be added in the future.

Structure-wise, the README should guide developers. Maybe start with an overview, then list the files with descriptions, and then outline how to navigate or contribute. Since there's only one file, the structure might be straightforward. But I should still present it in a way that's scalable if more files are added later.

I should also make sure to follow the user's instructions: output only markdown without the fences. No need for code blocks. Use headers, bullet points, etc., as appropriate.

Wait, the user mentioned "infer from names" for the files. Since there's only one file, sector-rotation.md, I can safely assume it's about sector rotation strategies. But maybe also consider if there are other possible files that could exist here, but the user only provided that one. So just describe that one.

Also, the structure part should help developers navigate. Maybe list the files in order of importance or logical flow. Since there's only one, it's simple. But perhaps mention that this folder is focused on sector rotation, and other sector-related topics might be covered here as well.

I should check if there's any standard way to structure such READMEs. Typically, they have a title, overview, table of contents, file descriptions, and maybe contribution guidelines. But the user specified three points: overview, file descriptions, and structure for navigation. So stick to those.

Make sure the language is clear and professional, suitable for a technical audience. Avoid jargon unless necessary, but since it's for a quantitative trading system, some domain-specific terms are okay.

Putting it all together:

- Start with a header for the README.
- Overview explaining the sector domain in the context of fundamental signals.
- List each file (only sector-rotation.md) with a brief description.
- Structure section explaining how the folder is organized, maybe mentioning that it's focused on sector rotation and how to navigate the documentation.

Double-check that I'm not missing any files. The user said the folder contains 'sector-rotation.md' and possibly other files/directories, but the list only shows that one. So just describe that one.

Alright, time to draft the markdown.

# Sector Domain Documentation

## Overview
The **sector** domain within the fundamental signals module focuses on analyzing and leveraging sector-based market dynamics to generate quantitative trading signals. Sectors represent broad economic categories (e.g., Technology, Healthcare, Energy) that group companies with similar business activities. This domain explores strategies that capitalize on sector rotation patterns, macroeconomic trends, and relative sector performance to inform investment decisions. Key concepts include sector classification, rotation timing, risk management, and integration with broader portfolio strategies.

## File Descriptions
- **sector-rotation.md**
  This document provides a detailed explanation of sector rotation strategies, including theoretical foundations, historical performance analysis, and implementation methodologies. It covers:
  - Sector classification frameworks (e.g., GICS, ICB)
  - Macro-economic indicators driving sector outperformance/underperformance
  - Quantitative models for identifying rotation signals (e.g., momentum, mean-reversion)
  - Backtesting results and risk-adjusted return metrics
  - Integration with execution systems and portfolio optimization

## Navigation Structure
This folder is organized to support developers in understanding and extending sector-based signal generation. The structure follows a logical flow:
1. **Conceptual Overview**: Start with this README to grasp the domain's purpose and scope.
2. **Core Strategy Documentation**: Review `sector-rotation.md` for in-depth technical details on rotation models and their implementation.
3. **Future Extensions**: Additional files or subdirectories may be added for:
   - Sector-specific risk models
   - Alternative data sources (e.g., sentiment, supply chain analytics)
   - Regional or global sector comparisons

For contributions or modifications, ensure alignment with the system's quantitative framework and validate changes through backtesting pipelines.
