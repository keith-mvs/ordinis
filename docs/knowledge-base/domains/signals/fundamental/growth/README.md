Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants a README.md for the 'growth' directory under the fundamental signals in their knowledge base. The folder has a file called growth-signals.md.

First, I need to start with an overview of the 'growth' domain. Since it's part of fundamental signals, growth probably relates to financial metrics that indicate a company's expansion. Things like revenue growth, earnings growth, maybe metrics like PEG ratio or growth rates. I should explain that this domain focuses on identifying companies with strong growth potential using fundamental data.

Next, the files. The only file listed is growth-signals.md. The name suggests it's a document explaining the various signals or indicators used to measure growth. So I should describe that this file likely contains definitions, methodologies, and examples of growth-related signals. Maybe also mention that it covers how these signals are calculated and applied in trading strategies.

Structure-wise, the README should help developers navigate. Since there's only one file, maybe outline the sections within growth-signals.md. Like an introduction to growth signals, specific metrics, implementation details, examples, and best practices. Also, mention any related directories or links to other parts of the knowledge base if applicable, but since the user didn't list any subdirectories, maybe just keep it simple.

I need to make sure the README is comprehensive but not too technical. It should guide someone new to the area on where to find information. Also, check that the overview is clear and the file description is accurate based on the name. Avoid any markdown fences as per the user's request. Let me put this all together in a structured way.

# Growth Domain Documentation

## Overview
The **growth** domain within the fundamental signals category focuses on identifying and quantifying company growth metrics to inform investment decisions. This domain leverages financial statement analysis, historical performance trends, and market dynamics to assess a company's expansion potential. Key areas of interest include revenue growth, earnings growth, cash flow acceleration, and market share expansion. These signals are critical for strategies targeting high-growth equities, momentum trading, or long-term capital appreciation.

## File Descriptions
- **growth-signals.md**:
  This document serves as the primary reference for growth-related signals. It likely contains:
  - Definitions of core growth metrics (e.g., YoY revenue growth, EPS growth rates, CAGR)
  - Methodologies for calculating and normalizing growth indicators
  - Examples of growth signal applications in trading strategies
  - Data source requirements and quality considerations
  - Visualizations or code snippets for signal implementation

## Navigation Structure
This directory is organized to provide a logical flow for developers and quants working with growth signals:

1. **Start with `growth-signals.md`**
   Begin here to understand the theoretical framework, key metrics, and implementation guidelines for growth signals.

2. **Explore Signal Implementations**
   If code examples or integration details are included in `growth-signals.md`, follow links or references to related repositories, libraries, or strategy templates.

3. **Cross-Reference with Related Domains**
   For context, review adjacent domains such as `valuation` or `profitability` in the fundamental signals hierarchy, as growth signals often intersect with these areas.

4. **Review Data Dependencies**
   Check data source documentation (e.g., financial databases, APIs) referenced in `growth-signals.md` to ensure proper data pipeline integration.

This structure ensures developers can move from conceptual understanding to practical implementation while maintaining alignment with the broader quantitative trading system architecture.
