Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants a README.md for the 'signal-combination' folder in their quantitative trading system documentation. The folder has one file: ensemble-signals.md.

First, the overview. Signal combination in quantitative trading probably involves methods to merge multiple signals into a single, more robust indicator. I should mention things like ensemble methods, statistical techniques, machine learning models, and how combining signals can improve accuracy and reduce noise.

Next, describing the files. The only file here is ensemble-signals.md. From the name, I can infer it covers ensemble techniques like bagging, boosting, stacking, maybe examples of combining different signal types, and best practices. I should list possible sections like introduction to ensemble methods, specific techniques, implementation examples, and evaluation metrics.

For the structure, the README should guide developers through the folder. Since there's only one file, the structure is straightforward. Maybe start with the overview, then the file description, and navigation tips. Also, mention related sections if there are any, but since the user didn't list others, maybe just note that this is part of a larger knowledge base.

I need to make sure the language is clear and technical but accessible. Avoid markdown fences as instructed. Check that each section addresses the user's points: overview, file descriptions, and navigation structure. Also, ensure that the README is comprehensive but concise, helping developers understand the content and where to find specific information.

# Signal Combination Domain

## Overview
The **signal-combination** domain focuses on methodologies and techniques for integrating multiple quantitative signals into unified, actionable insights for trading strategies. This domain addresses challenges such as signal correlation, redundancy, noise reduction, and the optimal weighting of diverse indicators (e.g., technical, fundamental, sentiment-based) to enhance predictive accuracy and risk-adjusted returns. Key concepts include ensemble learning, signal aggregation, statistical arbitrage, and hybrid model architectures.

## File Descriptions
- **`ensemble-signals.md`**
  This file provides an in-depth exploration of ensemble-based signal combination techniques. It likely covers:
  - **Introduction to ensemble methods**: Bagging, boosting, stacking, and blending approaches.
  - **Signal fusion strategies**: Weighted averaging, machine learning-driven aggregation, and dynamic signal prioritization.
  - **Case studies**: Examples of combining technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD) with macroeconomic or alternative data signals.
  - **Implementation guidelines**: Code snippets, parameter tuning, and backtesting frameworks for evaluating combined signals.
  - **Best practices**: Handling overfitting, ensuring diversification, and validating signal robustness across market regimes.

## Navigation Structure
This folder serves as a centralized resource for understanding and implementing signal combination logic. Developers should:
1. **Start with `ensemble-signals.md`** for foundational knowledge on ensemble techniques and practical implementation steps.
2. **Cross-reference related domains** (e.g., `signal-generation`, `risk-management`) for context on individual signal creation and risk constraints.
3. **Explore code repositories** linked in the documentation for hands-on examples of signal combination pipelines.

For advanced use cases, this folder may link to specialized topics such as:
- **Dynamic signal weighting** using reinforcement learning.
- **Signal decay models** for time-sensitive indicators.
- **Uncertainty quantification** in combined signals.

This structure ensures developers can progress from theoretical understanding to deployment-ready solutions.
