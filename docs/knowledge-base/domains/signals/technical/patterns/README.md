# Chart and Candlestick Patterns

## Overview

Pattern recognition identifies recurring price structures that may indicate continuation or reversal. While popular, most patterns have weak standalone predictive power and should be used as confirmation with other signals.

## Academic Warning

**Most patterns have weak standalone predictive power in academic studies.**

Use patterns as:
- Confirmation of other signals
- Context for entries/exits
- Risk management (pattern invalidation = exit)

Do NOT use patterns as:
- Primary entry signals
- Without volume confirmation
- Without trend context

## Pattern Classification

### By Expected Outcome
1. **Reversal Patterns**: Signal trend change
2. **Continuation Patterns**: Signal trend resumption
3. **Bilateral Patterns**: Could break either way

### By Timeframe Formation
1. **Single Bar**: Doji, Hammer, Shooting Star
2. **Multi-Bar (2-3)**: Engulfing, Harami, Morning Star
3. **Extended**: Triangles, H&S, Flags

## Best Practices

1. **Context is king**: Pattern at support/resistance is more meaningful
2. **Volume confirms**: Breakouts need volume surge
3. **Multiple timeframe alignment**: Higher TF pattern = stronger
4. **Wait for confirmation**: Don't anticipate pattern completion
5. **Know the failure point**: Invalidation level for stops
