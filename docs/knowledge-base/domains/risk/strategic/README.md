Okay, let's tackle this README.md for the 'strategic' domain in the risk section. First, I need to understand what strategic risk means in the context of quantitative trading. Strategic risk probably involves long-term risks related to business strategy, like market changes, competitive threats, or regulatory shifts that could impact the trading strategies over time.

The folder has a file called strategic-risk.md. Since there's only one file, the README should explain the overview of the domain, describe that file, and structure the navigation. The user wants an overview, file descriptions, and a structure to help developers navigate.

Starting with the overview: I should define strategic risk, mention how it's different from operational or market risk. Maybe talk about aligning trading strategies with long-term goals, monitoring external factors, etc.

Next, the file description. strategic-risk.md likely contains detailed information on identifying, assessing, and mitigating strategic risks. It might include frameworks, case studies, or methodologies specific to strategic risk management in trading systems.

Structure-wise, since there's only one file, the navigation is straightforward. But I should still outline the sections within the README, maybe list the file and its purpose, and suggest how to contribute or update the docs.

I need to make sure the language is clear and technical, suitable for developers working on quantitative trading systems. Avoid jargon but be precise. Also, ensure that the README helps someone new understand where to find information and how the content is organized.

Wait, the user mentioned "subdirectories" but the folder only has strategic-risk.md. So maybe there are no subdirectories, but the structure should still be mentioned. Perhaps the structure is just the single file, but the README can outline the typical sections within that file.

Also, the output should be markdown without the fences. So headings, lists, etc., but no code blocks. Let me structure it with # for headings, bullet points for descriptions.

Check if I need to mention contributing guidelines or contact info. The user didn't specify, but since it's a knowledge base, maybe a brief note on how to contribute or contact the team.

Putting it all together:

1. Overview of Strategic Domain: Explain strategic risk in quant trading context.
2. File Description: What's in strategic-risk.md.
3. Structure: How the folder is organized, maybe sections within the file.
4. Navigation: How to move through the docs, related sections if any.

Make sure it's comprehensive but concise. Avoid fluff. Use technical terms appropriately.

# Strategic Risk Domain Documentation

## Overview
The **strategic risk** domain within the risk management framework addresses long-term, high-impact risks that arise from the alignment (or misalignment) of trading strategies with organizational goals, market dynamics, and external environments. This domain focuses on risks that could compromise the sustainability of trading strategies over time, such as shifts in market structure, regulatory changes, competitive pressures, or misaligned business objectives. It emphasizes proactive identification, assessment, and mitigation of risks that may not be immediately apparent but could significantly affect long-term performance.

## File Descriptions
- **strategic-risk.md**:
  This document provides a detailed exploration of strategic risk concepts, including:
  - Frameworks for identifying and categorizing strategic risks in quantitative trading.
  - Case studies illustrating the impact of strategic risks on trading systems.
  - Methodologies for scenario analysis, stress testing, and risk mitigation planning.
  - Guidelines for integrating strategic risk assessments into the overall risk management lifecycle.

## Structure and Navigation
This folder is organized to support developers in understanding and implementing strategic risk management practices within the trading system. The structure is as follows:

1. **Core Concepts** (covered in *strategic-risk.md*):
   - Definitions and scope of strategic risk.
   - Key risk categories (e.g., market evolution, regulatory shifts, technological obsolescence).

2. **Implementation Guidance**:
   - Tools and processes for monitoring strategic risks.
   - Collaboration workflows between risk management, strategy development, and compliance teams.

3. **Examples and Templates**:
   - Sample risk assessment templates.
   - Code snippets or configuration examples for integrating risk checks into strategy deployment pipelines.

4. **Related Domains**:
   - Links to complementary documentation (e.g., market risk, operational risk) for cross-domain context.

## Developer Guidance
- **Getting Started**: Begin with *strategic-risk.md* to grasp foundational concepts.
- **Contributions**: Propose updates or new content via pull requests, ensuring alignment with the system’s risk governance policies.
- **Support**: Contact the risk management team for domain-specific clarifications or use cases not covered in the documentation.

This folder serves as a living resource to ensure strategic risks are systematically addressed throughout the trading system’s lifecycle.
