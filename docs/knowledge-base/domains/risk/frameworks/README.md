Okay, let's tackle this README.md for the 'frameworks' directory in the risk knowledge base. The user wants a comprehensive overview, descriptions of each file, and a structure to help developers navigate.

First, the overview. The 'frameworks' domain probably deals with the structural and methodological aspects of risk management in quantitative trading. I should mention that it's about the principles, processes, and models used to assess and manage risk. Maybe highlight that it's foundational for the trading system's risk management.

Next, each file. Let's go through them one by one.

risk-assessment-methodology.md: This should cover the methods and processes for evaluating risks. Techniques like VaR, stress testing, maybe scenario analysis. Also, how these are applied in the system.

risk-governance.md: Governance would involve policies, roles, responsibilities. How risk management is structured within the organization, compliance, oversight processes.

risk-scoring.md: Likely about assigning scores or metrics to different risks. Quantifying risks numerically, maybe using models or algorithms to prioritize them.

risk-taxonomy.md: Taxonomy is about classification. So categorizing different types of risks—market, credit, operational, etc.—and their relationships.

For the structure, maybe list each file with a brief description and links. Also, suggest how they interrelate. Like, taxonomy defines the categories, assessment methodology evaluates them, governance oversees the process, and scoring quantifies them.

Need to make sure the README is clear and helps developers find what they need. Maybe start with a quick start section, then detailed descriptions, and navigation tips.

Wait, the user said "structure that helps a developer navigate this section". So perhaps a section explaining how the files fit together. Maybe a flowchart in text form, like how to approach understanding the frameworks by starting with taxonomy, then methodology, etc.

Also, ensure that the markdown is clean, uses headers, bullet points, and links. Avoid any markdown fences as specified.

Let me check if I missed anything. The overview should set the context, each file's description should be inferred from the name, and the structure should guide navigation. I think that's covered. Alright, time to put it all together.

# Risk Frameworks Domain

## Overview
The **risk frameworks** domain within the knowledge base provides a structured foundation for understanding, assessing, and managing risk across quantitative trading systems. It outlines the methodologies, governance structures, and classification systems that underpin risk management practices. This domain is critical for ensuring consistency, transparency, and rigor in identifying potential threats to portfolio performance, regulatory compliance, and operational stability.

## File Descriptions
Below is a summary of the key files and directories in this folder, along with their likely contents:

### `risk-assessment-methodology.md`
- **Purpose**: Defines the processes and techniques used to evaluate risks, including quantitative and qualitative methods.
- **Content**: Likely covers risk identification frameworks (e.g., VaR, stress testing, scenario analysis), data requirements, model validation, and integration with trading workflows.

### `risk-governance.md`
- **Purpose**: Establishes the organizational structure and policies for overseeing risk management.
- **Content**: Details roles (e.g., risk committees, compliance teams), accountability frameworks, escalation protocols, and alignment with regulatory standards (e.g., Basel III, MiFID II).

### `risk-scoring.md`
- **Purpose**: Describes systems for quantifying and prioritizing risks.
- **Content**: Explains scoring models (e.g., risk-adjusted return metrics, probability-impact matrices), calibration processes, and integration with decision-making tools.

### `risk-taxonomy.md`
- **Purpose**: Classifies types of risks relevant to quantitative trading.
- **Content**: Categorizes risks (e.g., market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, operational risk) and their interrelationships, providing a shared vocabulary for risk discussions.

## Navigation Structure
This section is organized to guide developers through the logical flow of risk management frameworks:

1. **Start with `risk-taxonomy.md`**
   Understand the classification of risks to contextualize subsequent frameworks.

2. **Review `risk-assessment-methodology.md`**
   Learn how risks are systematically evaluated using quantitative and qualitative techniques.

3. **Explore `risk-scoring.md`**
   Discover how risks are prioritized and quantified for actionable insights.

4. **Study `risk-governance.md`**
   Align technical implementations with organizational policies and compliance requirements.

## Related Resources
For deeper dives into specific risk types or tools, refer to adjacent domains such as:
- `risk/models` for detailed risk modeling implementations.
- `risk/tools` for software and libraries used in risk analysis.
- `risk/reports` for historical risk assessments and incident analyses.

This structure ensures developers can navigate from foundational concepts to specialized implementations while maintaining alignment with governance and operational standards.
