Okay, let's tackle this README.md for the 'inbox' folder. The user wants a comprehensive overview, descriptions of the subdirectories, and a structure to help developers navigate.

First, the overview. The 'inbox' domain is probably where new information or projects are received. In a quantitative trading system, this might be where strategies, planning documents, and archived materials are stored. I need to explain that this is a central hub for managing incoming knowledge and projects.

Next, the subdirectories: archive, planning, strategies. Let's infer their contents. 'Archive' likely holds past projects, outdated strategies, or historical data. 'Planning' might contain project plans, roadmaps, or meeting notes. 'Strategies' would have documentation on trading strategies, algorithms, and their implementations.

For the structure, I should list each subdirectory with a brief description. Maybe a bullet list under each. Also, mention the purpose of each to guide developers on where to find what they need.

I need to make sure the README is clear and follows the user's structure. Start with a title, then the overview, then each subdirectory with their descriptions. Maybe add a note on how to contribute or contact for questions. Avoid markdown fences as specified. Keep the language professional but accessible.

# Inbox Knowledge Base

## Overview
The `inbox` directory serves as a central hub for organizing and managing incoming knowledge, project proposals, and strategic documentation within the quantitative trading system. It acts as a staging area for new ideas, ongoing planning efforts, and archived materials that require review, implementation, or reference. This structure ensures that all incoming information is categorized and accessible to the development and strategy teams.

## Directory Structure
The following subdirectories and files are contained within the `inbox` folder:

### 1. `archive/`
**Purpose:**
Stores historical or deprecated materials that are no longer actively used but may retain reference value. This includes retired trading strategies, obsolete planning documents, or outdated system configurations.

**Typical Content:**
- Archived strategy implementations (e.g., legacy algorithms)
- Historical backtesting results
- Superseded project plans or meeting notes
- Deprecated system architecture diagrams

### 2. `planning/`
**Purpose:**
Houses documents related to project planning, roadmap development, and strategic decision-making. This directory supports the coordination of development efforts and alignment with business objectives.

**Typical Content:**
- Project roadmaps and timelines
- Meeting minutes and action items
- Resource allocation plans
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Stakeholder communication templates

### 3. `strategies/`
**Purpose:**
Contains documentation and proposals for trading strategies, including quantitative models, execution logic, and performance analysis. This directory is critical for evaluating and implementing new trading ideas.

**Typical Content:**
- Strategy design documents (SDDs)
- Mathematical models and pseudocode
- Backtesting frameworks and results
- Risk management parameters
- Implementation checklists and code snippets

## Navigation Guide
Developers and strategists should use the following workflow to navigate this section:
1. **New Contributions:** Place draft documents or proposals in the relevant subdirectory (e.g., `strategies/` for new trading ideas).
2. **Review & Implementation:** Move items to active project directories once approved, and archive outdated materials to `archive/`.
3. **Reference:** Use `archive/` for historical context and `planning/` for project coordination.

For questions or contributions, contact the quantitative research or development team leads.
