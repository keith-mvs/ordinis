# Intelligent Investor

An AI-driven automated trading research and execution system.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the design, knowledge base, decision logic, and safeguards for an autonomous trading agent that will eventually execute trades via broker APIs under strict risk and compliance constraints.

## Project Phases

| Phase | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Knowledge Base & Strategy Design | In Progress |
| 2 | Code Implementation & Backtesting | Planned |
| 3 | Paper Trading & Simulation | Planned |
| 4 | Limited Live Deployment | Planned |
