# Session Context - 2025-12-01

## Current State

**Branch:** main
**Working Directory:** Clean (untracked: SIMULATION_SETUP.md, data/, src/data/)

## What's VERIFIED Working on Main

1. **ProofBench Simulation Engine** - TESTED, WORKING
2. **Strategies** - MovingAverageCrossover, MomentumBreakout, RSIMeanReversion
3. **Plugins** - IEXDataPlugin, PolygonDataPlugin
4. **Knowledge Base** - 10 domains, publications index with 15 entries
5. **Performance Metrics** - Full analytics available

## What We Need To Do

### Your Original Goal
> "Use NVIDIA models to SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE KB README.mds for enterprise documentation. Use RAG to query ENTIRE knowledge foundation (KB, plugins, tools, MCP servers) not just project KB."

### Current Blockers
1. **RAG System** - Source files deleted on main (only __pycache__ remains), but exists on research/general branch
2. **Documentation Enhancement** - Not started yet
3. **Holistic RAG Architecture** - Design needed

## Branches

- **main** - Production, simulation-ready
- **research/general** - Has RAG code, 5 commits ahead
- **user/interface** - Testing branch, has branch policies/docs

## Stashed Work

- "Temp stash: simulation setup work on main" - Can restore with `git stash pop`

## Next Decision Point

**What should we focus on RIGHT NOW?**

A. Get RAG working on main (restore from research/general)
B. Start KB documentation enhancement with NVIDIA
C. Run first historical simulation with real data
D. Something else entirely
