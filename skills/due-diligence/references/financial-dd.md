# Financial Due Diligence

Framework for evaluating financial health, unit economics, projections, and valuation of businesses and opportunities.

## Investigation Areas

### 1. Revenue Analysis

**Revenue Composition:**
- Revenue by product/service line
- Revenue by customer segment
- Revenue by geography
- Recurring vs. one-time revenue
- Professional services vs. product revenue

**Revenue Quality:**
- Customer concentration (% from top 10, 20 customers)
- Churn rate and cohort retention analysis
- Contract lengths and renewal rates
- Revenue recognition policy (ASC 606 compliance)
- Deferred revenue and backlog

**Growth Metrics:**
- Year-over-year growth rate
- Month-over-month growth (for earlier stage)
- Cohort-based growth analysis
- Net revenue retention (NRR) or net dollar retention (NDR)
- Growth efficiency (growth rate / burn multiple)

**Key Questions:**
- How sustainable is the revenue growth?
- What percentage of revenue is at risk (up for renewal)?
- Are there red flags in customer concentration?
- How "real" is the revenue? (Has it been recognized appropriately?)

### 2. Unit Economics

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):**
- CAC by channel (direct sales, marketing, partnerships)
- CAC by customer segment
- Blended CAC across all channels
- CAC trends over time
- Components: S&M spend / new customers acquired

**Customer Lifetime Value (LTV):**
- Average revenue per account (ARPA)
- Gross margin percentage
- Customer lifetime (1 / churn rate)
- LTV calculation: ARPA × Gross Margin × Customer Lifetime

**Key Ratios:**
- LTV:CAC ratio (target: 3:1 or better)
- CAC payback period (target: <12 months)
- Magic number (net new ARR / S&M spend, target: >0.75)
- Rule of 40 (growth rate % + EBITDA margin %, target: >40)

**Cohort Analysis:**
- Revenue retention by cohort over time
- Expansion revenue by cohort
- Payback period by vintage
- Customer behavior changes over cohorts

**Key Questions:**
- Does the business have positive unit economics?
- How long to recover customer acquisition costs?
- Is LTV improving or deteriorating?
- Do newer cohorts perform better or worse?

### 3. Profitability & Margins

**Gross Margin:**

- Interest coverage ratio
- Working capital position

**Key Questions:**
- Is the balance sheet healthy?

**Key Questions:**
- How much dilution would new financing cause?
